\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an overview of garbage collection (GC) and parallel
processing as well as how parallel processing applies to GC.
With that knowledge as our foundation, we will examine in detail various
algorithms that perform compaction of fragmented memory during garbage 
collection concurrently to the application running.
% The current paper format *only* allows inline comments using the todo
% macro. That's kind of a bummer, and it would be neat if someone figured
% out how to change the acmconf style to allow this. I suspect it isn't *hard*
% but there are quite a few details that have to be sorted out in synchrony.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\todo[inline, color=green]{General introduction left in here until I work on it.}

The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference, and conference
editors like ACM seek to give their conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance. We also would like our proceedings to look highly
professional, so we're borrowing heavily from the ACM formatting guidelines.
These include some
rigid requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (2.54cm [1"] top and
bottom and 1.9cm [.75"] left and right; specified column width
(8.45cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.083cm [.33"]).

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings,\footnote{One of these, the \texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor} command, 
you have
already used; another, \texttt{\textbackslash balancecolumns} will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.} the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands. Section~\ref{sec:body} introduces the main
examples of formatting, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} wraps things up. 

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\todo[inline]{Just threw stuff from outline in this section for now.}

This is where I explain terminology and aspects of GC and parallel 
computing that are necessary to understand my paper (If there is 
enough information in each subsection, I should maybe forego the 
background and just make them all sections)

\subsection{Garbage Collection}
\label{sec:garbageCollection}

References and the heap (if not done in the introduction)

General process flow GC algorithms tend to follow

Specific GC algorithms/techniques my researched papers will 
refer to and common techniques needed to understand my paper 
(Pauseless, tracing/marking, more)

Start introducing some terminology relevant to single processor 
garbage collectors such as: stop-the-world, fragmentation, compaction, 
tracing, reference remapping, etc.

Explain the three typical aspects of compaction 
(relocation/copying, remapping, and reclamation: 
reclamation is often just done through the other two)

\subsection{Parallel Processing}
\label{sec:parallelProcessing}

Threads: the virtual form of a processor (might need to 
explain virtualization or abstraction)

Issues experienced in parallel computing and reasons why it 
is difficult to perform effectively like: deadlock, race conditions, 
etc. (Real brief, but I feel the audience needs to have some idea of 
why progress in this area doesn't happen overnight. It also seems 
necessary for explaining barriers)

Typical ways of mitigating challenges experienced in parallel 
computing (synchronization, barriers/locks)

\subsection{Parallel Processing as it Applies to Garbage Collection}
\label{sec:parallelProcessingGarbageCollection}

Bring audience's attention back to the original focus introduced 
of wanting to use parallel computing to improve GC

Introduce new terminology for GC that depends on parallel processing 
in order to show some more specific ways in which parallel processing 
can be used to improve GC (mutator threads, parallelism, concurrency, etc.)

Describe the focus: Concurrent Compaction (If this has enough information, 
it could be moved out of being a component in a subsection)

\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
\label{sec:body}

Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{\textbackslash section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
\label{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}

We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{\textbackslash textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{\textbackslash textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{\textbackslash texttt}.
As a rule you'd prefer \texttt{\textbackslash emph} (which stands for \emph{emphasize})
over something like \texttt{\textbackslash textit} since that gives the typesetting system
more flexibility in how it can emphasize that text.

You do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
\label{sec:mathEquations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\label{sec:inlineEquations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{\textbackslash begin\ldots\textbackslash end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\ldots \$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
\label{sec:displayEquations}

A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation*}

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:

\begin{displaymath}
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}

and follow it with a numbered equation (Equation~\ref{eq:summation}):

\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}

just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
Note that if you use numbered equations, you can give them \texttt{label}s
and \texttt{\textbackslash ref} them, e.g., Equation~\ref{eq:summation}.

\subsection{Multi-line formulas}
\label{sec:multiLineFormulas}

The \texttt{align} and \texttt{align*} environments let you align sequences of
equations so, for examples, a sequences of equal signs line up nicely. 

% The & creates a "virtual tab stop" and corresponding &'s on each line
% will be aligned when the layout is done.
\begin{align*}
n_1 &= \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i \\
n_{x-y} &= \prod_{i = 1}^k b_i
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
 f(x) &= (x+a)(x+b) \\
 &= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
\end{align*}

\subsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of
a \textbf{.pdf} file to be displayable with \LaTeX, such as
Figure~\ref{fig:singleColumnFigure}.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =3in}
\caption{A sample graph just spanning one column.}
\label{fig:singleColumnFigure}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns, like Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}.  
To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\texttt{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
And don't forget to end the environment with
\texttt{figure*}, not \texttt{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =5.3in}
\caption{A sample graph that needs to span two columns of text.}
\label{fig:twoColumnFigure}
\end{figure*}

It's easiest and you tend to get the best quality if your figure uses vector graphics
in PDF format. You can include other formats such as PNG, but they will usually
not look nearly as professional, especially when printed on high resolution printers.
\emph{Be vary wary of screen captures from other papers. They tend to look pixelated
and amateurish even at high resolutions.}

\subsection{Tables}
\label{sec:tables}

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars} is included in the input file; 
compare the placement of the table here with the table in the
PDF output running \LaTeX\ on this document.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\label{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
Non-English or Math&Frequency & Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000 & For Swedish names\\
$\pi$ & 1 in 5 & Common in math\\
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000 & Unexplained usage\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption, as demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} below.  
As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}[t]
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\label{tab:typicalCommands}
\begin{tabular}{ccl}
Command & A Number & Comments \\ \hline
\texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor}     & 100 & Author alignment\\
\texttt{\textbackslash numberofauthors} & 200 & Author enumeration\\
\texttt{\textbackslash table}           & 300 & For tables\\
\texttt{\textbackslash table*}          & 400 & For wider tables\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Citations}
\label{sec:citations}

Citations to articles~\cite{Aaronson:2005,Garey:1979,Brun:2008} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file~\cite{OM:2008}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

It is recommended that you precede \texttt{\textbackslash cite} (and 
\texttt{\textbackslash ref}) commands with a tilde
character instead of a space, e.g., \texttt{some text\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite}. The tilde gives you a non-breaking space which ensures that your citation won't get
stranded by itself on the beginning of a line.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{\textbackslash cite},
which is all that is needed for our senior seminar.
You shouldn't use any other forms here.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\label{sec:theoremLikeConstructs}

Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{\textbackslash newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

Theorem~\ref{thm:integration} below uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} command:

% You would usually put a \newtheorem command up at the top 
% of your LaTeX document after the \usepackage commands. It's
% just here in this example so it's with the text that describes it.
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\label{thm:integration}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{align*}
l &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) \\
  &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ] \\
  &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}  \\
  &= 0\cdot L  \\
  &= 0,
\end{align*}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition~\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} or the
\texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
\label{sec:caveatForExperts}

Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{\textbackslash def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{\textbackslash def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{The Collie Collector}
\label{sec:collie}

We now look at the concurrent compaction technique used within the 
Collie garbage collector~\cite{Iyengar:Collie}. Like C4, the Collie is 
a fully concurrent compacting collector. It 
uses a tracing algorithm based on the one implemented in C4 for 
marking which objects are garbage. Likewise, the Collie uses a read
barrier similar to the Loaded Value Barrier (LVB) in C4 for 
compaction.

% TM isn't so much a concrete type of storage, but rather an abstraction
% used to describe memory that has been specified by a transaction procedure
% The TM itself is the software, hardware, or both that makes this detection
% of transaction memory possible
The Collie's compaction algorithm sets itself apart due to its use of a \emph{transactional memory} 
(TM) system as a concurrency control alternative to barriers. TM systems allow
sections of code to function 
analogously to \emph{transactions} from database systems, 
which are a series of operations performed as one unit where they either all
occur or none occur~\cite{wiki:atomicity}.
For example, consider updating the inventory of a store; this may involve updating
the price, quantity and distributor for various items. 
If a person was updating information regarding an item, they would 
want all three attributes of the item to be updated or none at all. Having
only a subset of the attributes updated could cause confusion.
TM systems allow a series
of operations that modify memory to be placed in
a \emph{transactional procedure}, much like a database transaction.
The TM system then monitors the access of concurrent threads to \emph{transactional variables}:
memory that is modified by a transactional procedure.
Concurrent threads will continue to operate in parallel until they try to modify
the same transactional variable. At this time, behavior can be specified as to how 
the conflict should play out, but the general pattern would be for one transaction
to be aborted and the other allowed to play out.
\todo[inline]{Add a citation here. (I mostly used stack overflow...)}


\subsection{Additional Background}
\label{sec:collieBackground}
%I'll probably want to change this subsection title.

% Two possible changes to come here. If C4 also does reclamation the "easy way"
% as described by FPP, then mentioning it in background and elsewhere can probably
% be simplified to a simple note of that being how it's handled by all the algorithms
% I discuss. Also, Might not need the refresher on relocation and remapping if talked
% about recently before.
With their use of a TM system for synchronizing concurrent compaction,
Iyengar et al. introduce new terminology. As discussed, compaction of
memory requires relocation of objects and remapping of references to
the objects; the Collie does reclamation by labeling the from-space as freed.
An object \emph{transplantation} consists of both the relocation and 
remapping of an object. A transplantation has not been completed until
the object's contents have been moved and all required references have been
updated. The authors note that all relocating collectors, and by extension all
compacting collectors, transplant objects~\cite{Iyengar:Collie}.

Each object in an application's memory has a \emph{referrer set}. This is the precise set 
of all references pointing to the object. 
An object has a \emph{transplantation state} consisting of the object's contents 
and the object's referrer set. This definition builds on the general requirements
for completing an object transplantation outlined by Iyengar et al. These
requirements include: all copies of an object's contents should remain consistent
until transplantation is completed and after transplantation, there cannot be any
references that point to the object's from-space location in its referrer set~\cite{Iyengar:Collie}.

\todo[inline]{Might need to add more background. Wait to see how discussing the algorithm goes. Add: mirrored to-space, zero-copy translation.}

\subsection{The Collie Protocol}
\label{sec:collieAlgorithm}

In their work to use a TM system to support concurrent thread 
synchronization, Iyengar et al. conceive of the first theoretical, 
but not practical, barrier-free compacting algorithm. From this,
they introduce a wait-free read barrier into the algorithm that has a bounded,
constant triggering time. That is, the synchronization barrier they introduce 
is certain not to cause time overheads over a constant value.
This is done to make the compaction algorithm practical and concurrent
such that it can be used in the overall Collie GC algorithm.
We will discuss both the theoretical compaction algorithm as well
as the modified concurrent implementation here.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Barrier-free Compaction Algorithm}
\label{sec:collieAlgorithmNoBarriers}

The compaction algorithm uses TM semantics to complete an object's
transplantation. The operations for transplantation are stored as a
transactional procedure. These operations include: the compactor 
starting a memory transaction, it "protecting" the referrer set, 
the object being copied to its new location and the references in the 
referrer set being updated to point to the new location of the object.
After, the transaction is \emph{committed}; the to-space object contents
and the reference values pointing to the object's to-space location
are finalized, which completes the transaction.

By the compactor "protecting" the referrer set, we mean the algorithm
writes to each of its references so they cannot be read from. 
Reads from the referrer set could expand, and thus modify, it. This could result
in references to the object being created that the transactional procedure
was not aware of when it started, so they are not updated to point to 
the new object location when it is finishing. Thus, for the transaction to
ensure all references are up-to-date upon completion, the referrer set needs
to be protected.

This brings us to discussing why this compaction algorithm is not concurrent. 
If the aforementioned transactional procedure is not
modified, there will be a gap between the transaction beginning and
the entire referrer set being written to and protected. This gap allows 
the referrer set to expand without the transaction knowing about it
as discussed.

To prevent this, the transaction must be started inside a \emph{global safepoint}.
A global safepoint is requested by a thread and is a moment when all 
threads are paused such that operations can be performed by the requesting thread without having to worry 
about references in the application changing. As a global safepoint requires pausing application
threads, this breaks concurrency.
Note that a safepoint differs from a barrier in GC. In a safepoint,
all threads are allowed to reach a certain point then their execution is simply paused.
A barrier works by telling threads how to behave if multiple try to access the same
memory. Thus, using a global safepoint does not break the goal of barrier-free compaction.
Within the global safepoint, the precise referrer
set is constructed, the transaction is started, and the referrer set is protected.
After this, the safepoint ends and other threads are allowed to continue concurrently
while TM semantics will ensure the relocation and remapping portions of compaction
are safe.

While it does not require traditional barriers, the cost of not using them effectively
requires stop-the-world phases. Global safepoints would need to be enacted for every 
object that is relocated. Thus, the number of stop-the-world pauses that would occur
during this barrier-free compaction is what makes it impractical.

\todo[inline]{Need references. Again, I used mostly random articles...}
\todo[inline]{Do you feel I need to explicitly state what would cause the transactional
memory to kick in and handle concurrency issues? I think I covered it enough with the
additional background.}

%Talk more about operations that would cause the transaction to be aborted and give examples?

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

a number.

It is common (but by no means necessary) for students to thank
their advisor, and possibly other faculty, friends, and family who provided
useful feedback on the paper as it was being written.
